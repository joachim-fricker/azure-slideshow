Due to the fact that without being an LG Partner one cannot access data stored on an USB drive (webosvintage library needed) the next 
approach for doing so is to provide a webapp for doing so. I have choosen azure as provider for the following reasons:
o) free hosting
o) lot of options
o) helps in my job
